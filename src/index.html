                About 2‚Äì3 people die from snake bites each year in Australia‚Ä¶

              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                I believe this is remarkably low and was comforted to learn
                this. It seems like most bites result from startling, cornering,
                or trying to handle a snake. Snakes are protected by law in all
                states and territories of Australia and you cannot kill them
                unless they threaten life.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                Eastern Brown Snakes are truly alarming and cause the most
                fatalities in Australia.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                Snakes have caused about as many deaths in Australia as hornets,
                wasps, and bees, but far fewer hospitalisations.
              </p>
              <p style="margin-top: 1rem">
                Identifying snakes is hard. What looks like an innocent keelback
                might be a highly venomous rough-scaled snake. Play it safe,
                don't get bit.

              I've excluded snake skin sightings, dead snakes, snakes seen by
              people outside my household, and snakes I've seen while
              travelling. I'm hardly a snake expert, so some snakes may be
              mis-identified.

              I found this book,
              <a href="https://nla.gov.au/nla.cat-vn7829994"
                >Snakes of the Sunshine Coast Region by Mike Donovan</a
              >, a valuable reference, which taught me fun facts not found on
              the Internet.
