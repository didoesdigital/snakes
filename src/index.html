              ‚Äú‚Ä¶ walking in undisturbed areas on cool days in September and
              October (early spring) risked running into courting male [Eastern
              Brown] snakes that would not notice people until close, as they
              were preoccupied with mating.‚Äù I can confirm, mating snakes are
              oblivious.

            I've excluded snake skin sightings, dead snakes, snakes seen by
            people outside my household, and snakes I've seen while travelling.
